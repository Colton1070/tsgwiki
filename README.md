# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Scripter's Guild Wiki!

{% hint style="info" %}
**The rest of the proposed structure should fit in, but I've just been focused on the POC for the Node side of things**
{% endhint %}

## Purpose

The purpose of this wiki is to provide adequate documentation surrounding Halo Infinite's scripting. Scripting, especially for newcomers, can be difficult to learn and even harder to master. The goal is to provide knowledge and information to help you navigate some of the obstacles that may come your way.

Rest assured though, that the journey to becoming a master begins here. View our tutorial or our documentation using the sidebar to the left.

For the more experienced, feel free to leave comments on pages with additional info you think would be useful! Some things don't quite act as documented either, so please let us know. And, if you aren't already, become a member of our Discord!
